Water Indicator for Tanks 


This is a hobby project, installed at my home for water management in tanks on the rooftop. This turns on the water pump when water in the tank level goes down a certain level and turns it off when the tank is filled. Further it also allows the user to manually turn ON/OFF water pumps through a mobile app.
